# Jędrzej Wydra, a.k.a. General Kenobi

As a “double master” — not a Jedi Master (though that would be pretty awesome), but someone who holds two master’s degrees — I’ve combined the fields of law and mathematics. Why did I choose this path? Once I heard a lawyer say, ‘If I could do math, I would be too powerful,’ and that was the moment when I decided to gain that power. When I’m not dissecting legal texts or crunching data, you can find me sipping fine Matcha, diving into psychology studies, or working on my calisthenics routine.
