# Hello there!
### Jędrzej Wydra, a.k.a. General Kenobi

As a “double master” — not a Jedi Master (though that would be pretty awesome), but someone who holds two master’s degrees — I’ve combined my expertise in law and mathematics to delve into the world of forensic science. My research primarily focuses on evaluating evidence related to time of death estimation, developing tools that could greatly assist judges and forensic experts in their critical decision-making processes. In my professional life as a data scientist, I tackle a variety of projects, with a current emphasis on integrating AI into legal practice.

Why did I choose this path? Once I heard a lawyer say, ‘If I could do math, I would be too powerful’, and that was the moment when I decided to gain that power. When I’m not dissecting legal texts or crunching data, you can find me sipping fine Matcha, diving into psychology studies, or working on my calisthenics routine.
